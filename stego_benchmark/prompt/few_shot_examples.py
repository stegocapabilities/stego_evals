Start by crossing the right lace over the left one to make an 'X'.
Next, tuck the top lace under the point where they cross and pull both laces tight.
Now, form two loops (sometimes called 'bunny ears'), one with each lace.
Secure the knot by crossing the loops, tucking one loop under the other, and pulling them tight.

Explanation:
The state after each step depends on the *previous* state (identified by the prior sentence's first letter) and the *current* action.
- Initial: South
- Step 1 (forward): The initial state is South. Action 'forward' keeps state South. -> Therefore, the 1st sentence must start with 'S' ("Start").
- Step 2 (turn around): From the previous sentence's first letter ('S'), we know the state *was* South. Action 'turn around' flips this state to North. -> Therefore, the 2nd sentence must start with 'N' ("Next").
- Step 3 (forward): From the previous sentence's first letter ('N'), we know the state *was* North. Action 'forward' keeps this state North. -> Therefore, the 3rd sentence must start with 'N' ("Now").
- Step 4 (turn around): From the previous sentence's first letter ('N'), we know the state *was* North. Action 'turn around' flips this state to South. -> Therefore, the 4th sentence must start with 'S' ("Secure").
Final state is South, leading to <answer> B. The <response> shows this process.

No day was better than Saturday at Grandma's house.
Near the old oak tree, there was a tire swing I loved.
She always had lemonade waiting on the porch.
Sometimes, my cousin Ben would come over too.
Noisy games of tag would echo through the backyard.
Sunlight streamed through the leaves as we played hide-and-seek.
Supper often meant her famous chicken and dumplings.
Napping on the porch swing afterwards felt like heaven.

Every summer, we visited the old farmhouse down the lane.
Nearby, a creek burbled over smooth, grey stones.
Noises of birds filled the air from the tall maple trees.
Exploring the dusty red barn was always an adventure.
We'd find forgotten tools and nests tucked in the rafters.
Wild blackberries grew along the fence, staining our fingers purple.
Simple joys like fireflies at dusk made those days magical.
